Everytime you create a class please make sure to
1) comment it your class to make your code clear and easy to debug
2) Write next to each method what arguments the method takes. The variables it uses and what it returns
3) Summarize the class here using a UML type summary (not nessecarily formal but so other coders will understand)

Eg:

Class ServoMover:
    Public Varibles: ...
    Private Variables: ...
    Private Methods: ...
    Public Methods: ..
    Static methods.....

(There is no need to explain in detail here just note a small sumarry like the one above)
