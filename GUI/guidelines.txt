For anyone working/ contributing on this project.

If you are creating a class be sure to follow the instructions written in the classes Summary text file
If you are creating a method that sends a signal to the arduino be sure to follow the instructions written in the signal_to_arudino_format text file

Additional Guidelines:

1)Variable Naming:
Do not use haphazard names as int x or string s as that will lead to conflicts in the commits that will be hard to find

Accepted Variable naming

"object_type"_"your chosen name"_"What part of program it belongs to"

example:
label_servo5_tab2

or if it belongs to a given class just make sure the name is elaborate enough to not be confused with other names and be easy in solving conflicts

example:
ServoAngle_Gamma_Degree
Leg2_Position_X
Leg2_position_y

and so on
